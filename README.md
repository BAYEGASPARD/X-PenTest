# OM Pentesting

This repository is a store for experiments
in pentesting Syft and Grid.

The aim of this work
is to identify
weaknesses in Syft and Grid -
places where they leak private information
or open up a party to attack.

**Important**:
as this repository shows,
neither Syft nor Grid
are suitable for use in a sensitive production environment.

## Contributing

If you would like to work on an investigative line of inquiry,
feel free to open an issue with your proposed method.
If you see an open issue you would like to work on,
let the team know in the comments.

### Submitting

**All work is useful**,
even if the attack did not work
as intended.

Please open a PR with new code
in the following structure:
`<tool-under-investigation>/<method_of_investigation>`.
For example,
code for
port scanning `PySyft`
might be placed under
`syft/port_scanning`.
Each method should have a `README.md`
file which explains:

* Brief explanation of the method
* Why the method is useful/possible outcomes
* Relevant links to further information on the technique
* Requirements for running the investigation
* Actual outcomes (blank if WIP)
