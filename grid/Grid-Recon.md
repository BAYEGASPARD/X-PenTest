## Grid Reconnaisance
This is mainly to discover the different services, ports, technologies the infrastructure uses.
This helps understand the underlying technologies, ports and services so we can search for the versions which are vulnerable, try to abuse `wrongly configured settings, try to gain control, escalade, bypass, fuzz` etc.
Tools used :
- `kali OS` with pre-installed tools. But you may need to manually install other custom tools like `ffuf` etc.
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Dirb
#### 1. Nmap : Used for network scanning, port discovery, services using NSE scripts and many more.
- `5 ports` opened, `5000`, `5001`, `5002`, `5003`, `7000`.
-  Ports `5000-5003` and `7000` uses `Ajenti http control panel` which is an open source project maintained by : http://ajenti.org/
- http-methods supported  `GET` , `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`. 
- Command used : `nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 <IP>` e.g nmap -p0- -v -A -T4 192.168.0.3
- Output screenshots.
- Open ports

#### 2. Nikto : Used for web server scanning.
- For both `Network` and `Wrokers node`, 
- `X-XSS-Protection header` is not defined which can lead to `XSS` attacks.
- `X-Content-Type-Options header` is not set. There is a possibility to `execute style sheet` and `steal` content from another site through content type doesnâ€™t match. More details[ here](https://geekflare.com/secure-mime-types-in-apache-nginx-with-x-content-type-options/).
- Network

- Command `nikto -url <url> -C all` , you can also use `nikto -h <url> -C all`. thet are similar.
#### 3. Dirb : use for directory discovery
- For the moment no sensitive directories found.
