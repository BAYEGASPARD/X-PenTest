# getting_started

Follow this guide to setup [Parrot Security](https://www.parrotsec.org/) with Docker on Oracle VirtualBox. Similar steps can be taken to setup [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) instead.

## Downloads

- Download [Parrot Security OVA](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/) virtual machine image and load it on VirtualBox

- Download and install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Virtual Machine Setup

- Launch VirtualBox and make a **New** virtual machine. Choose a name and select Linux in *Type* and Debian (64-bit) in *Version*.

- Assign resources according with [Parrot Security system requirements](https://docs.parrotlinux.org/info/system-requirements/) (e.g at least 2 GB of RAM and 40 GB hard drive)

- Create a Dynamically allocated Virtual Hard Disk and select VHD.

- Once created, use the Settings -> System tab to make sure *Optical* is first in Boot Order

- Also in Settings, but in the Storage tab, select *Add Optical Drive* (the disk  :cd: icon next to *Controller: IDE*) and select the Parrot Security image you downloaded previously.

## Parrot Security Install
- Launch your virtual machine and follow the installer's instructions. The *Install with GTK GUI* option is recommended for ease of use. You should be ready to boot Parrot Security OS afterwards.

## Docker Installation on Parrot Security  

- Inside your Parrot OS, [Install Docker Engine on Debian
](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) with **one important change**. Add the repository to sources list by:

    `$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list`

    Appending:

    `deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable`

    Note: You may get prompts about overwriting parameters on dependencies. **Ignore** all changes.

- Clone [PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid) and start testing
